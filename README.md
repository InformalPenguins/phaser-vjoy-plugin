Vjoy (phaser-vjoy-plugin)
=====================
 
How many of yours have had the need to add a virtual joystick to your new phaser project?
 
The options we have constrain us having the joystick static in one place in the screen. Most of the time this solution is not enough to give the best gaming experience.

What does this plugin for you?
-------------------------------------
 
Not all the people have the same finger length, neither the same screen size. Users have a very big pool of different devices and configurations, driving us crazy dealing with all of them.
 
That's why we developed a custom solution, and now we want to share it with you: **VJoy Plugin**.
 
The position is dynamic. Where you start to touch, the joystick will set its base. You should define the coordinates where the joystick will have effect. This let us having half of the screen ready for the joystick, and buttons in the other half.
 
We are working on many projects using this Phaser, and implementing this plugin. We're going to continue improving this plugin at the time we find more needs in our games. So, please feel free to use it and/or make the modifications you want. You can help us reporting bugs or improvements too registering issues in github.
 
We hope you like it.
 
Cheers.
